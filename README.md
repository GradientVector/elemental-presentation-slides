    * Bad UI/UX! (editing is slow or buggy, content gets jumbled on save, styles overwrite the editor, etc...)
        **** NATALIA COMMENT: Examples of bad UI (drop-down menus you can't click on)
    * Monolithic (more features than needed)
    * Does not support new trends like SPA Frameworks, Mobile, etc.
